# Setup
     
* Get [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview).
* Get [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* Confirm that docker is installed (type 'docker -v' and 'docker-compose -v'), docker should be >=1.13 and docker-compose >=1.6
* Clone the project, cd into the project directory.
* Build the docker containers:
```docker-compose build```
* Bring the containers up:
```docker-compose up```

If everything worked you should be able to see the angular application at [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1).
