# Fotogjengen 3.0

###What is this?
This is the repo for the new foto.samfundet.no, to be deployed to fgbeta.samfundet.no. 

###Why a new site?
We want to make more than a site, we want a web-application. We believe the current site poses greater potential than is exposed. 
The images taken by fotogjengen are of higher quality than the site exposing them can represent. 
The site is also less static than originally intended, it is used as a portal for uploading images and maintaining the entire fotogjengen archive. 
In effect a CMS (content management system) built from scratch. 
We believe it is high time to migrate to a RESTful api with a frontend application, this allows for less custom javascript strewn around and a more maintainable and consistent architecture.
Migrating to a front-end driven application also promises newer features.

###New features
Fotogjengen frequently sells print-outs of images, this is via emails at the moment.
We intend to implement a shopping cart that allows users to add images whilst browsing. 
Fotogjengen also offers their photography services to clients, this is also ordered via email at the moment.
Allowing potential clients to order via the site is beneficial. We also want to integrate 
facebook into the site, allowing users to like, comment, and share images on their feed.

In summary the new features are:
* Shopping cart for print-outs
* Order form for shoots
* Facebook integration

###When will be finished?
Work will be concluded in April (by students). A working implementation will be shown May 16th,
and the web-application released to the public 10th of August.
